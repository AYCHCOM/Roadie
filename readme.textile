h2. Shemail

WARNING: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE YET. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Shemail tries to make sending HTML emails a little less painful.

It was developed for use on "Purify: Awesome Bug & Issue Tracking":http://purifyapp.com

h3. Background

Writing inline styles for HTML emails is dull and boring but unfortunately
a necessary evil. Rather than do it by hand we thought it would be nicer 
to let our app do it for us.

We originally tried to use "awesome_email":http://github.com/imedo/awesome_email but unfortunately it 
either didn't work or was suspiciously slow (we're talking a minute to send
the email). 

So we decided to write our own lightweight alternative. Enjoy.

h3. Install

First install the dependencies:

<pre><code>sudo gem install nokogiri css_parser</code></pre>
  
Then install Shemail to your rails app:
  
<pre><code>script/plugin install http://github.com/purify/shemail</code></pre>
