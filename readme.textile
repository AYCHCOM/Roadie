<span style="color:#f00">WARNING: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE YET. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</span>

Shemail tries to make sending HTML emails a little less painful.

It was developed for use on "Purify: Awesome Bug & Issue Tracking":http://purifyapp.com

h3. Background

Writing inline styles for HTML emails is dull and boring but unfortunately a necessary evil. Rather than do it by hand we thought it would be nicer to let our app do it for us.

We originally tried to use "awesome_email":http://github.com/imedo/awesome_email but unfortunately it either didn't work or was suspiciously slow (we're talking a minute to send the email). 

So we decided to write our own lightweight alternative. Enjoy.

h3. Install

First install the dependencies:

<pre><code>sudo gem install nokogiri css_parser</code></pre>
  
Then install Shemail to your rails app:
  
<pre><code>script/plugin install http://github.com/purify/shemail</code></pre>

h3. Usage

Simply add the <code>css</code> method to your deliver actions:

<pre><code>class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
  def welcome_email
    css :email
    
    subject 'Welcome Aboard'
    recipients 'someone@example.com'
    from 'jimneath@googlemail.com'
    sent_on Time.now
  end
end</code></pre>

This will look for a css file called _email.css_ in your _public/stylesheets_ folder. The <code>css</code> method can take either a string or a symbol. You can also pass the css file name with or without the .css extension.

Shemail will now write the styles from _email.css_ into html part of the welcome email (eg. welcome_email.text.html.erb). It won't touch the plain text part, neither will it do anything if you're only sending a single part email (eg. welcome_email.html.erb). You shouldn't be sending html emails without a plain text version anyway.

Say that our _email.css_ file looks like the following:

<pre><code>body { background: #000 }
p { color: #f00; line-height: 1.5 }
.text { font-size: 14px }</code></pre>

And our _welcome_email.text.html.erb_ looks like this:

<pre><code><p class="text">Hello World</p></code></pre>

Then the resulting html that will be sent out will resemble the following:

<pre><code><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body style="background: #000"><p class="text" style="color: #f00;line-height:1.5;font-size: 14px">Hello World</p></body></html></code></pre>
